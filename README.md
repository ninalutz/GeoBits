# GeoBits
GeoBits is a geospatial rendering platform for generic visualizations and math models in different coordinate systems.

##Instructions
Download [Processing 2.2.1](https://processing.org/download/?processing) Processing 2.2.1, the development copy is currently only running in Processing 2, because there are some dependencies. If you haven't used Processing before, check out their site because the documentation is very user friendly.
Install  [Unfolding Maps library](http://unfoldingmaps.org) and [HTTP requests](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) in Processing 2.
Download or clone this repo. Open the folder that says "Demo" and run Demo.pde in Processing 2. Make sure you have a good internet connection!
Run and follow directions. Remember this code is constantly being developed, so please be patient.
